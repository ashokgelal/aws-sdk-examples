# AWS SDK Examples

Examples of performing specific actions in AWS across various languages via AWS official SDK's.

## Languages

* Golang
* Node
* PHP
* Python

## How to use these examples

This is a collection of examples. We try to make them usable by having ways for you to install dependencies and simply running a file in the language of your choice. However that may not be possible in all cases, especially for examples that depend on resources to exist within your AWS account.

## PR's Welcome

Pull Requests are welcome to fix/improve any exanmple, or to add additional examples. PR's should consist of:

1. **Working** code that attempts to copy the style of other examples
2. Explanation where needed (usually via code comments)
3. *Hopefully* complete examples (an example in each language)
